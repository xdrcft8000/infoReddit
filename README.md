InfoReddit is an web application for information and sentiment gathering on Reddit.

The app takes a keyword, link or reddit post, and searches Reddit for matching posts. It performs sentiment analysis on the top comments using Python's NLTK, and returns a set of PHP graphs that represent the trends on Reddit related to your search term over time.
