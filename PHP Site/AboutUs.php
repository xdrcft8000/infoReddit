<h1> About Us </h1>


<p>
    InFoReddit is a project we are working on as part of our group module at Cardiff University.
    Our aim was to build a tool which allows the user to provide a link and get information regarding its spread on
    Reddit, including the Top Subreddits where it was posted, and the number of upvotes it has.
    We hope that you'll find this tool fun to use and be able to navigate through it easily.

    content the users of this tool might be exposed to.
